Loving what you do, does not mean that you love every task you’re presented with. I wake up every morning ecstatic about what I get to do, however, the majority of the tasks I do are not for me. I’m playing the long game and it’s so clear that I am on the right path. The joy comes from the understanding that there is progress towards the goal. You need to find joy in the macro and allow that to colour the micro. If we allow our micro frustrations to colour our macro outlook on our careers, you will undoubtedly feel stuck and frustrated. Zoom out and take a look at the journey you’re on. If you are learning and developing skills that are helping you move towards your goal, find joy. If you are not being nurtured, then take action, it’s often mindset rather than circumstance.
