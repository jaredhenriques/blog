This holiday was the first break that I had taken from work in a while. At first it felt very weird to be waking up and ignoring my to do list. I honestly struggled to stop and rest. I only ever ended up in this weird middle ground where it was just low level worry about what I should be doing without fully disconnecting. 

The issue that I am experiencing now is that I am sort of still stuck in that middle ground of being unproductive but "busy”.  The difficulty that I have had with transition to and from rest has reminded me about the law of interia.

The holidays snuck up on me this year and I did not do any preparation for the rest that I was going to be having over the holiday. Without this preparation I was just trusting that I could abruptly change states and do so well. Likewise, I did not prepare a way to transition back into to work. Obviously this did not work out for me. 

I would assume that I would need to prepare and plan a *force* on either side of the break to help me change states more effectively. 

This week I am mainly interested in hearing from you. What are some ways that you are able to turn off and back on successfully? Have you developed any practices to help prepare for these transitions? I would truly love to hear any tips that you may have.
