# The difference between who I am and who I am pretending to be

Created: Feb 23, 2015 1:11 AM

Self-awareness has started to deplete incredibly, I would argue that it is not a result of less self reflection, but rather an increase of self reflection and a lack of honesty.

Currently we form our identities on social media. This isn’t to demonize social media but to merely point out that, the reality of who we are doesn't seem so concrete anymore. At first these facades seem harmless, because one would assume that the harsh realities of our humanity would slap us in the face eventually. Unfortunately we have started to believe the persona that we have built for the public so much so that we have lost sight of ourselves. We believe in our own facade. When creating our facades we tend to leave out the fact we are human, and when we cannot live up to who we project upon the world depression and insecurities run rampant. We internalize these negative feelings, ashamed and lonely, because no one else seems to be fat, or selfish, or boring. Everyone seems to be adventuring and doing amazing things, while I sit here and let Netflix know that I am still here and wish it would stop asking.

What do we do with this then? How do we reclaim our identity? The only way this is possible is to do it in it’s entirety. The good and the bad. Own the stuff that we are good at, and come to terms with the things we are bad at. It’s ok that Rebecca is better at taking Instagram photos than me and that Johnny always has a really intelligent quote. Everyone has their stuff, Rebecca and Johnny are likely going through similar inferiority complexes. Owning the things that we struggle with and things that we aren’t good at is so incredibly beneficial not only in working towards improving them, but also in creating a proper priority of our goals.

“I don’t know the difference between who I am and who I am pretending to be” has become a sad reality for most, but very few have enough courage to admit that to themselves and really take control of their identity. Our weaknesses are as much a part of us as our strengths. Pretending that we don’t have weaknesses makes them more and more glaring. It is not until you own it and proactively address it that it can start to improve.

As a youth leader I have the privilege of hanging out with teenagers once a week which is not only really fun, it is incredibly interesting to see a uniform desire to talk about real stuff without judgement or condemnation. When asking some of our students in a one on one setting they express a desire to be honest and open and hear more about each others lives, but they all are waiting for someone else to go first.

Grab a friend you trust and take them for a coffee. Go first, tell them some stuff that’s bugging you, some stuff that you are struggling with. You will be surprised how much you will develop personally and how much your relationship with this trusted friend will strengthen. You may even be surprised when they say “Me too”.

Don't know the difference between who I am and who I am pretending to be

Our generation is incredibly depressed because they are seeing all of these images and videos of who they want entirely trying to live and live up to that.

Stop trying start being

I was having a really cool conversation about self awareness with a friend and they were starting to get really frustrated at the lack of understanding they were having of themselves. They had then said one of the most insightful things they could have said in that moment which I found incredibly brave. After trying to think of who they are, what they are good at, what they are not too good at and much more they said “I don’t even know the difference between who I am and who I am pretending to be.” I stayed silent and I believe the weight of what they had just said started to sink. At first it was a feeling of panic and despair at this realization but it was followed by an incredible relief from the bondage this unspoken truth held. I tell this story because I think the place they were in is far more common than most realize. Self awareness is depleting quickly and we need to reclaim it!

Young people like myself have been brought up in a culture where as we were forming our identities social media started to rise. The reality of who we are doesn't seem so concrete anymore, we now have the ability to create our identity through our profiles online. At first this seems harmless, because one would assume that the harsh realities of our humanity would slap us in the face eventually but that has only become partially true. We have started to believe the persona that we have built for the public so much so that we have lost sight of ourselves.

There is an incredible insecurity that comes in the moments we know we aren’t as “good” as the person we portray and we feel boring, ugly, worthless. We see all these images and videos on instagram, youtube, twitter of things we wish we were doing and at first it seems really cool, but then we realize that we aren’t doing those things. “Everyone else is so much more artistic, creative, adventurous, beautiful than me.” “I wish my instagram looked like theirs”. I work with youth and I hear these things all the time, in fact, I say these things a lot of the time as well.

Rewrite with the thesis of: “the depleting self-awareness in our society and the re-association of our identity to our social profiles"
