# Personal Vision Statement

A vision statement is a critical part of every reason. We all know that it is, but i imagine you know very little if any of companies vision statement. So why is it so important? It is important because it acts as a compass for a company. It is a statement that allows businesses to measure major decisions off of. I believe that everyone should develop a personal vision statement for the same reason. This gives them something to help guide how they spend their free time, volunteer time and even give some direction as to where you should be working. So what’s mine?

Something along the lines of:

"I like to dream, conspire and collaborate about a better way. Do good.”

Is it broad? Yes. But that is the point. This is a statement that I can bring life decisions back to. Will this endeavour allow me to work towards a better way? Will I be adding value to peoples lives? If the answers to these questions are “no”, I will probably not take the oppourtunity even if the short term rewards are nice. Just like I don’t believe a company should ever go against who they have set out to be for the sake of making a sale or nailing a big account. Would it kill or alter your company culture? Is it really worth it?

These thoughts come from many conversations about which career path to follow. The way that I am navigating this big question is by measuring what I know I would love to do and where I would be best utilized. That happens when I am working inline with my vision statement. At the end of the day I don’t care how much you pay me if I am doing something I enjoy. If we don’t have the personal metrics to base decisions off of we will settle to compare dollars and follow the richest path. You deserve to do things that excite you, don’t settle for a few dollars more if it takes away your excitement.

I would love to hear some of your personal vision statements. Shoot me an email and let me know what you are all about!
