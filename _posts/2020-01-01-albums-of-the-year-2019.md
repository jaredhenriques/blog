Every year for this past decade I have released a top albums of the year at the new year. As I was making this years list I took a look at the archives of these lists and was blown away that the first one I did was for 2010. 

An important note when reviewing my list for this year and past years if you want to look back. The criteria for the albums on these lists are all albums I have listened to a lot, that were also released in the year of the list. Many times, the album I listen to the most throughout the year, does not make the list because it was released the year prior and I missed it when it was released. So if there are glaring omissions, that may be why.

This year was a good one for music. I feel that my list got longer than it normally is because as I was scrolling through spotify I was really excited about a lot of these albums. 

At the top of this year it will need to be *-Ugh, those feels again* by Snoh Aalegra. I listened to this album so much this past year. It was also an album release that I added to my calendar and was consciously counting down the days for. That doesn't happen too much anymore.
