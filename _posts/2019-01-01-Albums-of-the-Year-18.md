For the past few years I have released lists of my top albums from the year. I think that it is worth mentioning the process that I have crafted these lists. At the end of the year my criteria is always albums that I listened to lots throughout the year that were released in that same year. Many times, the album I listen to the most throughout the year, does not make the list because it was released the year prior and I missed it when it was released. So if there are glaring omissions, that may be why. I would always appreciate that you reach out and tell me about an album I missed just in case though.

This year’s list is quite late. I found that I listened to a lot of podcasts when driving this year. The majority of my music consumption would be while working. This might be evident in the style, or perhaps not. I’ve been listening to a lot of Jordan Rakei, Loyle Carner, Berhana, Snoh Aalegra, Nick Hakim, Raveena who all released their latest albums in 2017, so they will not qualify for this list.

Tom Misch - Geography

Mac Ayres - Something to Feel

SABA - CARE FOR ME

Jorja Smith - Lost & Found

Mac Miller - Swimming

Noname - Room 25

S. Carey - Hundred Acres

Charlotte Day Wilson - Stone Woman

Stimulator Jones - Exotic Worlds and Masterful Treasures *

Bahamas - Earthtones

LANY - Malibu Nights

*Was just shown this album, but it needs to be on the list, if it helps anyone discover him

As I look at the list I am realizing that I listened to more of the music from 2017 this year than music released this year. Check out the artists I mentioned in the first paragraph if you want a better representation of what my 2018 sounded like.

My friend [Matt Im](http://matthewim.com/) just started working with Renga and he is the source for the majority of my music. Maybe I’ll convince him to start posting his playlists more publicly. They are what I spend a lot of time listening to.

## twenty seventeen

As I sat down to make this list I realized I ended up listening to a lot of the albums on last years list over and over with some new additions from 2016 that weren’t on my list. 2016 really was an incredible year of music, the best since I’ve been doing this in my opinion. There were some strong albums this year still here are the ones I listened to the most.

Daniel Caesar - Freudian

SZA - Ctrl

Tyler, the Creator -Flower Boy

Kendrick Lamar - DAMN

Sampha - Process

LANY - LANY

Arcade Fire -Everything Now

Julien Baker -Turn Out the Lights

Leif Vollebekk - Twin Solitude

Rapsody -Laila’s Wisdom

H.E.R. - H.E.R.

I also really enjoyed some of these guys but didn’t really listen to enough to include in the ten above.

Maggie Rogers -Now That the Light is Fading

Alvvays -Antisocialites

Fleet Foxes -Crack-Up

Logic -Everybody

Khalid -American Teen

Drake -More Life

Mount Kimbie -Love What Survives

King Krule -The OOZ

I know I missed some big ones, like Lorde, The War on Drugs, Kurt Vile, The National. I will listen to those more to really appreciate them, but I wanted to be honest in my list. Let me know if I made some grotesque oversights.

## twenty sixteen

Big year in music. This year had some incredible albums. I found I was listening to a lot more hip-hop and soul music. Traditionally the majority of albums on these lists are indie rock. Some of my top bands from the last few years came out with some great albums, but I found that I really didn’t give them too many plays. I have been listening to podcasts while commuting and listening to music while at work. Not sure if this affects the music selection or that there was just so many amazing hip-hop and soul albums out this year.

Anderson .Paak-Malibu

Bon Iver-22, A Million

Chance the Rapper-Coloring Book

Frank Ocean-Blonde

Kanye West-The Life of Pablo

Childish Gambino-”Awaken, My Love!”

Local Natives-Sunlit Youth

James Blake-The Colour In Anything

James Vincent McMorrow-We Move

Noname-Telefone

NxWorries-Yes Lawd!

These albums are all really good and I found myself go back to them for a good period of time. I don’t feel I listened to them enough to put them in the above list, but they are all highly recommended.

The Suffers-The Suffers

Michael Kiwanuka-Love & Hate

St. Paul & the Broken Bones-Sea of Noise

Isaiah Rashad-The Sun’s Tirade

Vulfpeck-The Beautiful Game

Mac Miller-The Devine Feminine

Glass Animals-How To Be A Human Being

SOL-The Headspace Traveller

J Cole-4 Your Eyez Only

Young the Giant-Home of the Strange

Solange-A Seat at the Table

This year I am also going to start posting what I’ve been listening to each month. I always love hearing some recommendations. If you think I’d really dig somebody let me know!

This year was an interesting year for me with how I listened to music. I was working from home for the majority of the year and my job was speaking on the phone so I had much less time to listen to music. I still listened to some good ones, but didn’t find as much new music as normal. Here are 15 of my favourite albums that were released in 2015.

Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment- Surf

Alabama Shakes - Sound & Color

Sufjan Stevens - Carrie & Lowell

Shlohmo - Bad Vibes

Tame Impala - Currents

Seoul - I Became a Shade

Mute Math - Vitals

Half Moon Run - Sun Leads Me On

Vulfpeck - Thrill of the Arts

Liana La Havas - Blood

Made In Heights - Without My Enemy What Would I Do

Glass Animals - Zaba

Beirut - No No No

Grimes - Art Angels

I am sure I missed some good ones like Adele and Beibs, but we all know they were both great. Chvrches, Modest Mouse and Chilly Gonzales had some good ones as well that I didn’t listen to enough to include. Let me know some other ones I missed.
